Stat lectures for bachelors

This is started from the text which was created by Dmitrii Zotikov 
(many thanks to him)
on the base of lectures on Statistics during Bachelor's programme
(Lecturer: Nina Golyandina, St.Petersburg State University,
Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics, Department of Statistical Modeling).

The aim of the repository is to correct and improve the text.
It will be a slow process because of lack of time.
